# Distributed N-Queens Solver

A solution to the [N-Queens problem (LC 51)](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-queens/) expanded into a small application. Place `N` queens on an `NxN` board with no mutual attacks, solved efficiently with backtracking and distributed task processing.

## Overview

This project implements N-Queens problem and extends to include the possibility of pre-placed queens and adds an api that can query the solver (/solve?n=9&preplaced=0,1) such that specific starting positions can be entered. In the case of large N the original solution becomes inpractical quickly. To counteract this I intend to use RabbitMQ to queue tasks for multiple workers to calculate concurrently

### MVP Features
- **Input**: CSV format (e.g., `n, preplaced` like `8, [(0,1)]`).
- **API**: `/solve?n=8&preplaced=0,1` returns solutions as JSON.
- **Output**: Console prints boards (e.g., `Q . . .` for each row).
- **Distributed Solving**: RabbitMQ queues tasks for large `N` (e.g., split rows across workers).
- **Tech Stack**:
  - Python: Backtracking solver.
  - Go: API server (`net/http`), CSV parsing, RabbitMQ producer/consumer.
  - Docker: Deployment.

### Planned Extension (Option)
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Pygame 2D board to preplace queens and animate solutions.
- **Caching**: Redis for storing common `N` solutions (e.g., `N=8`).
- **Timeline**: 3â€“4 weeks.
